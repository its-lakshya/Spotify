### Abstract

If you love listening to music online, you might be familiar with Spotify, one of the most popular music streaming platforms. But have you ever wondered how Spotify's web interface is designed and coded? This project is a clone of Spotify's music player using HTML and CSS. 

### Tools And Technologies
In this project, I have focused on the HTML and CSS part of the web application. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is used to define the structure and content of a web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is used to style and format the appearance of a web page.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to create a web application that looks like Spotify's music player, but does not have any functionality or interactivity. This means that the buttons, sliders, menus, and playlists are only for display purposes and do not work. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my CSS skills and how to use various properties and selectors to create a responsive and attractive layout.

### Responsiveness
The web application will be responsive, meaning that it will adapt to different screen sizes and devices. I will use media queries and flexbox to achieve this. Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow us to apply different styles depending on certain conditions, such as the width or height of the screen. Flexbox is a layout mode of CSS that allows us to align and distribute items in a flexible way.
